<div align="center"> Minecraft Spigot plugin and (possibly) mod for Forge/Fabric/Quilt, featuring maximum potential optimizations without breaking mostly game mechanics. </div>

<div align="center"> <h1>  Current Features </h1> </div>
This is a very WIP and have very raw concept, but have a lot of potential of being useful by optimizing a new 1.18 Worldgen and Mob AI to possible limits.
 Seriously, this repository is junk a blank. Should be potentially compatible with Lithium and Sodium and other optimizing mods or plugins.
